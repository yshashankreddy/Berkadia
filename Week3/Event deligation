EVENT DELEGATION:
----------------
In event delegation, we take advantage of the fact that events bubble in the event loops by setting an event listener on one parent. 
This event listener analyzes bubbled events to find a match in its child elements.
Event delegation is one of the most helpful patterns for DOM events.
It simplifies things and can save memory since there is no need to add many handlers.

The algorithim:

Put a single handler on a container
In the handler - check the source element using event.target
If the event happened inside an element that interests us, then handle the event

EXAMPLE:
-------

document.querySelector('body').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  if (event.target.tagName.toLowerCase() === 'li') {
    // do your action on your 'li' or whatever it is you're listening for
  }
});
