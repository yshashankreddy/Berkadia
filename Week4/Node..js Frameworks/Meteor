Meteor:
------


             Meteor is an open-source, model-view controller (MVC) framework for building websites and web/mobile applications. 
The framework supports OS X, Windows, and Linux. It allows writing both client and server parts of an application in JavaScript.
              Meteor's inbuilt set of pre-written, self-contained modules makes writing application codes. Moreover, its reactive programming model allows creating applications using lesser JavaScript code. Besides, Meteor is a powerful framework for building real-time applications. 
Popular applications built using Meteor are Respondly (a team collaboration app), Blonk (Job search mobile App) and more.
