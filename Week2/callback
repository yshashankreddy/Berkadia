Callback  :
---------
		 A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing.
			 In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions. 
		 Functions that do this are called higher-order functions.
		 Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.


Program to illustrate callback:
------------------------------
		  
function first(){
  setTimeout( function(){
    console.log(1);
  }, 500 );
}
function second(){
  console.log(2);
}
first();
second();


OUTPUT:  2
