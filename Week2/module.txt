Modules:
-------

Module in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files .
Each module in Node.js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules.
 Each module can be placed in a separate (.js )file under a separate folder.
So that every module is reusable in Node.js.
There are  three types of modules:
1.Core Modules
2.Local Modules
3.Third Party Modules

Core Modules:
The following table lists some of the important core modules in Node.js.
http, url, querystring, path, fs, util. 
In order to use Node.js core or NPM modules, you first need to import it using require() function.
var module=require(‘mod_name);

Local Modules:
Local modules are modules created locally in your Node.js application.
 These modules include different functionalities of your application in separate files and folders.
Create a module with name (name) and save it as name.js and export it.
Var mymodule=require(‘./name.js’);
