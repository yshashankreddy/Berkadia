Promises  :
--------
		The core idea behind promises is that a promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation.
		 A promise is in one of three different states:
		      ->pending - The initial state of a promise.
		      ->fulfilled - The state of a promise representing a successful operation.
		      ->rejected - The state of a promise representing a failed operation.

Program to illustrate Promise:
-----------------------------

function readFile(filename, enc){
  return new Promise(function (fulfill, reject){
    fs.readFile(filename, enc, function (err, res){
      if (err) reject(err);
      else fulfill(res);
    });
 });
}


This function has two arguments:
		       -> The first argument fulfills the promise and the second argument rejects the promise. 
		       -> Once the operation has completed, we call the appropriate function.

Advantages:
----------
		      ->promises are cleaner way for running asynchronous tasks to synchronous
		      ->Also  provide catching mechanism which are not in callbacks.
		      ->Promises are built over callbacks, elegant way to handle asynchronous programs.
		      ->Promises  allow cleaner and better, functional code with less errors.
