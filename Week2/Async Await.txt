
Async/Await :
-----------
		Asynchronous requests will wait for a timer to finish or a request to respond while the rest of the code continues to execute.
		Then when the time is right a callback will spring these asynchronous requests into action.
	        ->A couple of months ago async/await landed in V8, the JavaScript engine.
		->await may only be used in functions marked with the async keyword. 
		->If the awaited expression isn’t a promise, its casted into a promise.
 

Program to illustrate Async/Await:
---------------------------------

function add(){ 
a=6;
return a;
}
async function getTrace () 
{ 
let Content 
try { 
Content = await add(); 
} 
catch (e) {
 console.error(e);
} 
return Content 
} getTrace() .then()
