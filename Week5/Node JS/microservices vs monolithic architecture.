 Monolithic applications are built as a                          |                microservice architecture is nothing but an                                      
 single package, that has all required components                |                approach to application development, where an

Gets bigger and bigger over iterations, and becomes              |                The size will remain substantially smaller,
difficult to manage and takes really long to startup,            |                as each component is dissected to smaller services.

Continues deployment becomes difficult, as a small               |                 Continues deployment is possible here, as
change to a component in the application, requires               |                 each service can be deployed independent of each other.

Scaling of application requires entire application               |                 Scaling of individual component is possible here,
scaling(ie: to launch multiple instances of the big              |                 as each different component is de-coupled 
monolithic application to serve the need), even                  |                 to different services, and can be scaled up
